# Arab World Capitals App
GitHub repository for my first programming project, the Arab World Capitals App, which I developed in 2019 using MIT App Inventor.

# Project Overview
Project Name: Arab World Capitals App
Date: 2019
Development Platform: MIT App Inventor

# What I Built
The Arab World Capitals App features a user-friendly interface with the following components:

1.Map of Arab World: The app includes an interactive map where users can tap on a country to learn about its capital city.

2.Country Flags: Each country is represented by its flag when you tap on it.

3.Audio Feature: To make learning even more engaging, I added an audio component that plays the country name and its capital when the user taps on it.

# Future Plans
I'll simply leave it as is.
